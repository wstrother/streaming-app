# AHP's Streaming App

This project is in the initial development stages, but just to give a brief overview, I'm working on a perspective web application that will allow for public userbase to create, configure, and employ a host of different features and functionalities to enhance their streaming experience, particularly by creating graphical layouts that respond in real time to state variables that can be managed by a user interface as well as the deployment of a remote bot that can interface directly through a chat application.

Currently in the initial stages I'm utilizing:

* SvelteKit - for frontend UI components as well as some Server Side Logic
* SupaBase - for DB and user auth
